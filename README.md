# 🎧 Spotify Landing Page Clone

A frontend-only **landing page inspired by Spotify**, created as part of my internship task using **pure HTML and CSS**.

This project focuses on layout design, UI consistency, and replicating the structure of a real-world website — without any frameworks or JavaScript.
